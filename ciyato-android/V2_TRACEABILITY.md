# Ciyato V2 Traceability Register

Active source of truth: `Ciyato_Comprehensive_Implementation_Specification_Dark_Expanded.pdf` (pages 1-49). This register deliberately excludes all older manuals and concepts. A status of `partial` means the code may contain a related surface, but it does not yet satisfy the V2 acceptance criteria.

## Implementation Order

1. State machine, design tokens, safe editing and the Home/workspace foundation (pages 3-14).
2. Approved App Library and internal navigation cleanup (pages 15-23).
3. Authorised Files/index/search/cleanup foundation (pages 24-32).
4. Edit sheet, Wallpaper Studio, app intelligence, settings and Photos (pages 33-40).
5. Security, performance, accessibility, migration and real-device acceptance (pages 41-49).

No entry moves to `complete` only because the project compiles. It requires the stated behavioral evidence, and device-only interactions remain for a physical Android device.

## Current Evidence

- `compileDebugKotlin`, `testDebugUnitTest`, and `assembleDebug` all passed on 23 July 2026. The 33 passing unit tests cover classifier confidence and ambiguity handling, launcher interaction transitions, picker-scoped URI persistence, workspace migration, cleanup-result safety, independent file-search history/index behavior, persisted Group/Card category presentation behavior, and schema-checked manifest-category evidence.
- Fresh debug artifact: `Ciyato.apk` (24,487,275 bytes, SHA-256 `7C62D551C6D7C38FEDFD6F102BA97EF729F5B447256A7FA2B2BFB28B2F4B774C`). This is a debug build, not a store-release artifact.
- Photos persists only explicit Photo Picker URI references, validates them before display, supports search, grid, timeline, collections, selection, removal from Ciyato, and Android-approved source deletion where the platform permits it.
- Workspace storage now uses a versioned `WorkspaceLayout` with stable IDs, creation order, visual order, and a one-time migration from the legacy page-indexed preferences. The UI and remaining workspace overview flows still require physical-device validation before completion.
- Files is limited to a user-selected Storage Access Framework root and Photos to explicit Photo Picker selections; both use truthful selected-access states. Cleanup and internal search are scoped to that root. A revoked SAF grant clears the local file index and blocks search results until the folder is selected again; device acceptance remains outstanding.
- Files cleanup now runs as a cancellable WorkManager job with a bounded, persisted checkpoint and full SHA-256 verification for same-size candidate files. It never deletes automatically; device workflows and broader indexing still require validation.
- Internal file search has a separate on-device history with a clear action and an opt-out that removes its stored history. It preferentially queries a bounded local metadata index for the selected folder and falls back to scoped scanning when no matching index exists. Workspace migration keeps Ciyato first on Workspace 1 and honors a persisted default workspace at launcher start.
- Onboarding now presents the full seven-step V2 guide, including the safe launcher-role handoff and feature-specific access model; it does not request file, photo, calendar, or location access during setup.
- Category editing now supports an explicit compact Group or resizable Card presentation, custom collection rename/icon updates, app membership changes, merge, removal without uninstall, an accessible move-to-workspace action, and Undo for creating a new category. Classification records evidence candidates and keeps low-confidence or tied results in Review until the user confirms a category.
- Launcher inventory refreshes are serialized and reuse the in-memory inventory on ordinary short Home resumes; explicit user corrections still recalculate from the package manager.
- Classification accepts only a validated local Android manifest category after package-seed evidence. Unknown or malformed metadata cannot overwrite user corrections or leave Review prematurely.
- Launcher app shortcuts now route their explicit Ciyato actions to Focus, Permission Audit, and App Library rather than silently opening the Home screen.
- Theme Studio now presents only implemented static-dark appearance settings, Files/Photos/Calendar settings route to their real destinations, Privacy Mode has an accurate scope description, and the Crash Reporting setting now controls whether the installed crash handler writes reports.
- Play submission remains blocked by the API level: this build targets API 34 while the current new-app requirement is API 35 or higher. The machine lacks a complete API 35/36 base platform, and no physical-device verification has been run by request.
